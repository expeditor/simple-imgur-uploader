# Simple Imgur Uploader - Chrome Extension #

It does very simple thing: With right-click menu, you can transfer images to [Imgur](https://imgur.com) in web sites. That's it.

When you right-click to an image, you will see `Upload to Imgur` menu-entry. (This is why we require `contextMenus` permission)
Uploaded image URL will be shown in new tab. (This is why we require `tabs` permission)
